## Dream Factory: Fan Art

You need to build an art installation. It will look similar to the [Wind Portal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25hLj3fxJSE) at BART's SFO station. It involves 10 columns of small, spinning metal pinwheels on a pole, like this:

```
||||||||||
0000000000
||||||||||
0000000000
||||||||||
0000000000
||||||||||
0000000000
||||||||||
```

You need to find 2 ways to make each column spin when something moves past that column. For each way, identify:

1. What programming languages and frameworks you intend to use
1. What, if any, libraries you intend to use
1. What hardware you need
1. How all of these pieces will work together

Use `solution-1.md` and `solution-2.md` to fill out your answers. Please include diagrams where appropriate.
